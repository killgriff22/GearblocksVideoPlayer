# To install  
* subscribe to the mod on the [workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3533429455)  
* if you dont already have it, get a version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) newer than 3.9  

# To use
1. load the script mod from the scriptmods menu inside gearblocks.  
2. press the spawn screen button, and wait. this is gonna take a while as it has to spawn in 2500 light objects.
3. move the screen to your desired viewing location, optionally unfreeze it for a minor fps bump and a better viewing experience.
4. run the python script called "Video2Bitmap.py", and watch as the screen springs to life!  
5. if you want to use your own video, replace "Bad Apple.mp4" with any other file. make sure it retains the name "Bad Apple.mp4", or the script will not know what file you want.
